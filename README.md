# H5Bitmap
a tool i made so not just me can look at the pretty pictures in h5.
if you wanna install the directx sdk and make it not output dds files be my guest.
probably will be made obsolete by something better by someone else, probably.

youre gonna need to extract the goodies from the module files with fivetool or whatever, bitmaps are always in the pc modules, not any.

if you are having trouble try extracting your modules closer to your drives' root.
